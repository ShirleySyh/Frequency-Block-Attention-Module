# Frequency-Block-Attention-Module
This repo contains the code for our paper "Frequency Block Attention Module in Fine-Grained Satellite Video Object Detection". We propose FBAM, a plug-and-play fine-grained feature learning module for satellite video fine-grained object detection.

The code will be coming soon.
